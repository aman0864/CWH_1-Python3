# In this tutorial you will learn about how to make short our code
# But, remeber if you try to make a code as shorter as you can then the redability of that code will definetely decreasses

print("Enter the value of A")
a = int(input())
print("Enter the value of B")
b = int(input())

print("A is greater than B") if a > b else print("B is greater than A")55
# So, short hand if statement is the process of making our code size as small as possible
# But use short hand if statement very carefully because it reducess redability
